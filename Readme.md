Reworked musical tesla coil

We reworked musical tesla coil in smaller scaling. Using an application with which we choose a song we send it to the coil interrupter. Then the interrupter sends out modified pulses which interrupt the coil supply so that the output to the coil has the same frequency as the audio signal.
