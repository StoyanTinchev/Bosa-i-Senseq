Reworked musical tesla coil

Authors: Stoyan Tinchev and Alexandar Alexandrov
--------




We reworked musical tesla coil in smaller scaling. Using an application with which we choose a song and send it to the coil interrupter. Then the interrupter sends out modified pulses which interrupt the coil supply so that the output to the coil has the same frequency as the audio signal.
